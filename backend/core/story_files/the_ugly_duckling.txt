STORY CONTENT: 
A mother duck sat on her nest waiting for her eggs to hatch.
One by one, cute yellow ducklings came out of their shells.
The last egg was bigger and took longer to hatch.
When it finally opened, a gray duckling appeared.
This duckling looked very different from the others.
He was larger and had gray feathers instead of yellow.
The other ducklings made fun of him for being ugly.
Even his mother thought he looked strange.
The farm animals called him the ugly duckling.
He felt sad and lonely every day.
The ugly duckling decided to run away from the farm.
He wandered through fields and forests alone.
Wild ducks and geese also said he was too ugly.
Winter came and the duckling nearly froze.
A kind farmer found him and took him home.
The farmer's children wanted to play with him.
But the duckling was scared and ran away again.
He spent the cold winter hiding by a frozen lake.
When spring came, the duckling felt stronger.
He saw beautiful white birds swimming on the lake.
They were elegant swans with long necks.
The duckling wished he could be as beautiful as them.
He swam toward the swans expecting them to chase him away.
But the swans welcomed him warmly.
When the duckling looked at his reflection in the water, he gasped.
He had grown into a beautiful white swan.
He was not an ugly duckling after all.
The swan joined his new family and felt happy for the first time.
He learned that being different can be wonderful.
