STORY CONTENT: 
Hansel and Gretel lived with their father and stepmother.
The family was very poor and had little food.
The stepmother convinced the father to take the children to the forest.
She wanted to leave them there so there would be more food.
Hansel heard the plan and filled his pockets with white stones.
The next day, their father led them deep into the woods.
Hansel dropped white stones along the path as they walked.
Their father left them alone in the forest.
When night came, the children followed the stones home.
The stepmother was angry to see them return.
A few days later, she made the father take them away again.
This time Hansel only had bread crumbs to mark the path.
Birds ate all the bread crumbs during the day.
Hansel and Gretel were lost in the dark forest.
They walked for days looking for their way home.
Finally, they found a house made of gingerbread and candy.
The hungry children began eating parts of the house.
An old witch came out and invited them inside.
She locked Hansel in a cage to fatten him up.
She made Gretel work as her servant.
The witch planned to cook and eat both children.
Every day she checked to see if Hansel was fat enough.
Hansel was clever and held out a thin bone instead of his finger.
Finally, the witch decided to cook Gretel first.
She told Gretel to climb into the oven.
But Gretel was smart and pushed the witch into the oven instead.
Gretel freed Hansel from his cage.
They took the witch's jewels and found their way home.
Their stepmother had died and their father welcomed them back happily.
