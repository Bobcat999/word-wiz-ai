SSML GENERATION INSTRUCTION:

In addition to the standard output format, you must also generate an SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language) version of your feedback for accurate text-to-speech pronunciation. 

Your JSON output must include BOTH fields:
- `feedback`: Plain text feedback for display to the user (as specified in your existing instructions)
- `feedback_ssml`: SSML-enhanced version of the same feedback with proper phonetic markup

SSML Guidelines:
1. Use `<phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="PHONEME">word</phoneme>` tags to specify correct pronunciation for problem phonemes
2. Use `<break time="300ms"/>` before and after phoneme tags to allow the listener to better understand the pronunciation 
3. Use `<emphasis level="moderate">text</emphasis>` to highlight important corrections
4. Use `<break time="500ms"/>` for strategic pauses between ideas
5. Use `<say-as interpret-as="spell-out">letters</say-as>` when spelling out individual letters or phonemes

Both `feedback` and `feedback_ssml` should convey the same information, but `feedback_ssml` should include pronunciation guidance through SSML markup.
