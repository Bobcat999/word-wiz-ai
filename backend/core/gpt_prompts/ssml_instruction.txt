SSML GENERATION INSTRUCTION:

In addition to the standard output format, you must also generate an SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language) version of your feedback for accurate text-to-speech pronunciation. 

Your JSON output must include BOTH fields:
- `feedback`: Plain text feedback for display to the user (as specified in your existing instructions)
- `feedback_ssml`: SSML-enhanced version of the same feedback with proper phonetic markup

SSML Guidelines:
1. Use `<phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="PHONEME">word</phoneme>` tags to specify correct pronunciation for problem phonemes
2. Use `<emphasis level="moderate">text</emphasis>` to highlight important corrections
3. Use `<break time="500ms"/>` for strategic pauses between ideas
4. Use `<say-as interpret-as="spell-out">letters</say-as>` when spelling out individual letters or phonemes
5. Use standard letter combinations in SSML like "th", "sh", "ch" rather than IPA symbols when possible for better TTS compatibility

Example SSML feedback:
```
"feedback_ssml": "Great job! <break time=\"300ms\"/> I noticed you pronounced the <phoneme alphabet=\"ipa\" ph=\"k\">c</phoneme> sound as <phoneme alphabet=\"ipa\" ph=\"t\">t</phoneme> in the word cat. <break time=\"500ms\"/> The <emphasis level=\"moderate\">c sound</emphasis> is made by pressing your tongue to the back of your mouth. <break time=\"300ms\"/> Try again with <phoneme alphabet=\"ipa\" ph=\"kÃ¦t\">cat</phoneme>!"
```

Both `feedback` and `feedback_ssml` should convey the same information, but `feedback_ssml` should include pronunciation guidance through SSML markup.
